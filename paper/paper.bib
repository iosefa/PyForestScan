	abstract = {Forest processes that play an essential role in carbon sequestration, such as light use eﬃciency, photosynthetic capacity, and trace gas exchange, are closely tied to the three-dimensional structure of forest canopies. However, the vertical distribution of leaf traits is not uniform; leaves at varying vertical positions within the canopy are physiologically unique due to diﬀering light and environmental conditions, which leads to higher carbon storage than if light conditions were constant throughout the canopy. Due to this within-canopy variation, three-dimensional structural traits are critical to improving our estimates of global carbon cycling and storage by Earth system models and to better understanding the eﬀects of disturbances on carbon sequestration in forested ecosystems. In this study, we describe a reproducible and open-source methodology using the R programming language for estimating leaf area density ({LAD}; the total leaf area per unit of volume) from airborne {LiDAR}. Using this approach, we compare {LAD} estimates at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Maryland, {USA}, from two airborne {LiDAR} systems, {NEON} {AOP} and {NASA} G-{LiHT}, which diﬀer in survey and instrument speciﬁcations, collections goals, and laser pulse densities. Furthermore, we address the impacts of the spatial scale of analysis as well as diﬀerences in canopy penetration and pulse density on {LAD} and leaf area index ({LAI}) estimates, while oﬀering potential solutions to enhance the accuracy of these estimates. {LAD} estimates from airborne {LiDAR} can be used to describe the three-dimensional structure of forests across entire landscapes. This information can help inform forest management and conservation decisions related to the estimation of aboveground biomass and productivity, the response of forests to large-scale disturbances, the impacts of drought on forest health, the conservation of bird habitat, as well as a host of other important forest processes and responses.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the literature concerning forest and woodland structure at the scale of an individual stand. Stand structure is deﬁned in terms of structural attributes and stand structural complexity. Stand structural complexity is considered to be a measure of the number of different attributes present and the relative abundance of each of these attributes. The review indicates there is no deﬁnitive suite of structural attributes; different authors emphasise subsets of different attributes, and relatively few studies provide quantitative evidence linking attributes to the provision of faunal habitat or other measures of biodiversity, although a number of studies identify attributes that distinguish between successional stages. A summary of key structural attributes identiﬁed in the literature is presented under the following stand elements: foliage arrangement, canopy cover, tree diameter, tree height, tree spacing, tree species, stand biomass, understorey vegetation, and deadwood. Indices of structural complexity are also reviewed. Three types of index framework are identiﬁed: indices based on the cumulative score of attributes; indices based on the average score of groups of attributes; and indices based on the interaction of attributes. The review identiﬁes a variety of different indices under each of these frameworks with no single index preferred over the others. The most prominent of these indices are discussed in detail and the following guidelines suggested for the development of an index of structural complexity: (1) Start with a comprehensive set of structural attributes, in which there is a demonstrated association between attributes and the elements of biodiversity that are of interest. (2) Use a simple mathematical system to construct the index; this facilitates the use of multiple attributes and interpretation of the index in terms of real stand conditions. (3) Score attributes relative to the range of values occurring in stands of a comparable vegetation community. (4) Try different weightings of attributes in the index, adopting those weightings which most clearly distinguish between stands.},

	abstract = {Quantification of forest structure is important for developing a better understanding of how forest ecosystems function. Additionally, estimation of forest structural attributes, such as aboveground biomass ({AGBM}), is an important step in identifying the amount of carbon in terrestrial vegetation pools and is central to global carbon cycle studies. Although current remote sensing techniques recover such tropical forest structure poorly, new large-footprint lidar instruments show great promise. As part of a prelaunch validation plan for the Vegetation Canopy Lidar ({VCL}) mission, the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor ({LVIS}), a large-footprint airborne scanning lidar, was flown over the La Selva Biological Station, a tropical wet forest site in Costa Rica. The primary objective of this study was to test the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments to recover forest structural characteristics across a spectrum of land cover types from pasture to secondary and primary tropical forests. {LVIS} metrics were able to predict field-derived quadratic mean stem diameter ({QMSD}), basal area, and {AGBM} with R2 values of up to .93, .72, and .93, respectively. These relationships were significant and nonasymptotic through the entire range of conditions sampled at the La Selva. Our results confirm the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments to estimate important structural attributes, including biomass in dense tropical forests, and when taken along with similar results from studies in temperate forests, strongly validate the {VCL} mission framework.

	abstract = {Airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) is a remote sensing technology known for its applicability in natural resources management. By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, {ALS} has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of {ALS} as a tool for improving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of {ALS} among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the {ALS} community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software ({FOSS}) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the {lidR} package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, {lidR} is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using {ALS} data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the ‘state-of-the-art’ and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like {lidR} are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open {ALS} tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline.},

It is suggested that, as a result of these problems, species diversity has become a meaningless concept, that the term be abandoned, and that ecologists take a more critical approach to species—number relations and rely less on information theoretic and other analogies. As multispecific collections of organisms possess numerous statistical properties which conform to the conventional criteria for diversity indices, such collections are not intrinsically arrangeable in linear order along some diversity scale. Several such properties or "species composition parameters" having straightforward biological interpretations are presented as alternatives to the diversity approach. The two most basic of these are simply ▵
