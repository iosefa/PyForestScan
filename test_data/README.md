# Test Data

The las test data in this repository was provided courtesy of Juan Guerra-Hernandez and Adrian Pascual. `20191210_5QKB020880_DS05.copc.laz` is a downsampled noise-free classified point cloud dataset processed following Pascual et al. 2020. The preprocessing steps described in Pascual et al. (2020) have been utilized in several other studies, including: Guerra-Hernandez et al. (2023), Pascual and Guerra-Hernandez (2023), and Pascual et al. (2021). Derived canopy height metrics for the island of Hawaii can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13151991 (Guerra-Hernandez and Pascual 2024).
