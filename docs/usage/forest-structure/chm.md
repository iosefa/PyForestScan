# Canopy Height Models

Canopy height is given as the maximum height above ground for a point within each grid cell or for all points within a given polygon.

$$H_{\text{canopy}} = \max(HAG_{\text{points}})$$

Where:

-   $H_{\text{canopy}}$ is the canopy height for the grid cell or polygon.
-   $HAG_{\text{points}}$ represents the set of heights above ground of all points within a given grid cell or polygon.

To calculate canopy height and generate a canopy height model, we first import the `caulculate_chm` function
