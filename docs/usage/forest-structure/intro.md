# Introduction

The core forest structural metrics generated by PyForestScan are based on well-established methods in ecology.

Most calculations for the metrics follows the method outlined in Kamoske et al. 2019.

## Metrics

* [Canopy Height Models (CHM)](chm.md)
* [Plant Area Density (PAD)](pad.md)
* [Plant Area Index (PAI)](pai.md)
* [Foliage Height Diversity (FHD)](fhd.md)
* [Canopy Cover](canopy_cover.md)
